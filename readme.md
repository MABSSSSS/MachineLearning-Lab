beginner to intermediate:

**intro to data science:**

DS is field of study that deal with extracting insights and knwoledge from data. It involves a combination of stats, computer science and domain expertise.

Data scientist use data to solve problrms and make informed decisions.

**-->workflow:**
Data collection: gathering data from various resources.
Data cleaning:handling missing values , removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies.
Data analysis:employing stats method to explore data patterns.
Visualization:creating visual representation of data for easier understanding.
Interpretation: making data driven decisions based on analysis. 

**Tools Required**

**Data Acquistion and cleaning:
web scraping: beautiful soup, scrapy.
API Integration: Request, Postman.
Data cleaning: Pandas , Open Refine.

**Data Storage and Management:
Databases: Relational and non-relational
Cloud Storage: Google, Microssoft and amazon S3.

**Data Exploration and Analysis:
Data Analysis: Pandas, Numpy and scipy.
Data viuslaization: matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.

**Machine leraning:
Libraries: Scikit learn, tensor flow, pytorch.
model deployment: tensor flow serving , ML flow.

**Python:**

->high level genral purpose language.
->known for simplicity, readibility and vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

**why python in datascience:**

data analysis libraries:
data visualizatuon library: matplotlib: seaborn: 

**INTRO TO DATA VISULIZATION:**
is art of representing daat graphically, I t hep us understand patterns, trends and realtionship in data that might be difficult to discern from raw numbers.

common types of visualization:
bar charts: for comparing categories.
line charts: for showing tredns.
scatter plots. for showing relationships between variables.
histograms: for understanding the distributuion of single variable.

libraries:
matplotlib. fundamental library 
seaborn.: high level visualization lib builton matplotlib , for creaiting plots with less code.

**INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING:**
is subset of AI that invloves teaching computers to learn from daata.
It enables machine to make predictions and decisions without being explicitly programmed.

types of machine learning:
Supervised : algorithm trained on labeled data.
Unsupervised: algorithm patterns in unlabelled data.
Reinforcement : learns throught trial and error , reciecving rewards or penalities for its actions.

examples: netflex,amazon,doctors,buisnesses.

**supervised learning:**
 regression -linear
classification-naive bayes
K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
decision trees
random forest
SVM
Gradient boosting.
ridge regression, lasso regression and logic regression

**unsupervised:**
clustering
Kmeans
heirarchical 
DBSCAN
Gaussian Mixture Models.
Dimensionality.
